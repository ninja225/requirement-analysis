# What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is a critical phase in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) that focuses on identifying, gathering, and defining the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a software system. According to the SWEBOK Guide (IEEE Computer Society, 2014) and ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148:2018, requirements analysis ensures that the product being developed addresses the actual problems and objectives of users, customers, and the business.

Key Aspects of Requirement Analysis:

Elicitation – Gathering requirements from stakeholders, end-users, and domain experts.

Documentation – Recording requirements in clear, unambiguous, and structured formats.

Validation – Ensuring that requirements are correct, complete, consistent, and feasible.

Management – Tracking, updating, and controlling changes to requirements throughout the project.

Importance in SDLC:

Foundation for Design and Development
Requirement analysis provides the blueprint that guides system architecture, design, and coding. A well-defined set of requirements reduces ambiguity and helps developers build the right solution.

Minimizes Costly Errors
Studies show that fixing defects later in the development cycle is significantly more expensive than addressing them during requirements analysis. By clarifying needs early, teams can avoid misunderstandings and rework.

Improves Communication
It bridges the gap between stakeholders and the technical team. Clear requirements help align business goals with technical solutions.

Supports Testing and Validation
Requirements serve as the baseline for creating test cases. This ensures the final product meets both functional and non-functional expectations.

Enables Better Project Management
Accurate requirements improve effort estimation, scheduling, and risk management, leading to higher project success rates.


## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

Requirement Analysis is a crucial step in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) because it lays the foundation for building software that truly meets business needs and user expectations. Without it, projects often face misalignment, scope creep, or failure. Below are three key reasons why it is critical:

1. **Clarity of Objectives**  
   Requirement Analysis ensures that all stakeholders have a clear and shared understanding of the system’s goals. This helps avoid confusion, misinterpretations, and conflicting expectations later in the project.

2. **Risk Reduction**  
   By identifying potential challenges, constraints, and dependencies early, Requirement Analysis reduces the risk of costly errors, rework, or project failure. It provides a roadmap that helps the development team anticipate and mitigate risks.

3. **Efficient Resource Utilization**  
   With well-defined requirements, teams can allocate time, budget, and technical resources more effectively. This prevents wasted effort on unnecessary features and ensures that development is focused on delivering the highest-value outcomes.


## Key Activities in Requirement Analysis

Requirement Analysis involves a series of structured activities to ensure that the system being developed meets the needs of stakeholders. The five key activities are:

- **Requirement Gathering**  
  Collecting initial information from stakeholders, customers, and users about what the system should achieve. This step sets the foundation for further analysis.

- **Requirement Elicitation**  
  Using techniques such as interviews, surveys, workshops, brainstorming, and observation to uncover explicit and hidden requirements from stakeholders.

- **Requirement Documentation**  
  Recording requirements in a clear, organized, and structured manner (e.g., using Software Requirement Specification (SRS) documents). Documentation ensures requirements are accessible to all stakeholders.

- **Requirement Analysis and Modeling**  
  Analyzing requirements for feasibility, consistency, and completeness. Modeling techniques like use case diagrams, data flow diagrams (DFDs), or UML diagrams may be used to visualize and refine requirements.

- **Requirement Validation**  
  Ensuring that the documented requirements accurately reflect stakeholder needs. This may involve reviews, walkthroughs, or prototyping to confirm correctness and completeness.
